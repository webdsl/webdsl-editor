entity hirarchie:
flatten:
	mobl model: 
		1. add extra properties to super for every sub entity 
			1.b.1 rename where there are 2 properties with same name
			1.b.2 rename inverse that points to a renamed prop thing
			1.b.3 also lookup of inverse props is needed to be replaced to super and original names
		2. replace all the type of sub to super
		3. filter out subclasses 
		4. filter out properties that are only form itself
		5. addExtraPropertyToSetType
	mobl_view:
		for free
	json:
		1.only fill own properties but need to use rename if needed
			1.b first find out rename again.
			1.c rename them afterwards with dr lookup
		2. set typeProperty
	generate-mobl-unsynced-functions:
		1. remove subentities
	generate-mobl-services:
		1. remove subentities
	generate-mobl-total-sync-function:
		1. flatten/map to parents 
	make-mobl-mapper-for-all-entities
		1. remove subentities
	generate-sync-services
		1. remove subentities
		2. map super to itself + childeren
	edit-mapper-functions:
		1. map to good name when renamed
		2. map to good entity

		
entity-multiple entrances:
	mobl model: 
		1. add sync+ lastsynced for every top level node
			.b mobl to flatten hirarchie only top one needs it(once, no rename)
	mobl_view:
		1. the normal view should be for free
		2. sync view needs tabs for every type
			a. map the screen to control every topEntity(might differ for entities)
			b. make the screen with just a tabset

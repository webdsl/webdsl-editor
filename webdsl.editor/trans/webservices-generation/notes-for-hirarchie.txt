entity hirarchie:
flatten:
	mobl model: 
		1. add extra properties to super for every sub entity 
			1.b.1 rename where there are 2 properties with same name
			1.b.2 rename inverse that points to a renamed prop thing
			1.b.3 also lookup of inverse props is needed to be replaced to super and original names
		2. replace all the type of sub to super
		3. filter out subclasses 
		4. filter out properties that are only form itself
		5. addExtraPropertyToSetType
	mobl_view:
		for free
	json:
		1.only fill own properties but need to use rename if needed
			1.b first find out rename again.
			1.c rename them afterwards with dr lookup
		2. set typeProperty
	generate-mobl-unsynced-functions:
		1. remove subentities
	generate-mobl-services:
		1. remove subentities
	generate-mobl-total-sync-function:
		1. flatten/map to parents 
	make-mobl-mapper-for-all-entities
		1. remove subentities
	generate-sync-services
		1. remove subentities
		2. map super to itself + childeren
	edit-mapper-functions:
		1. map to good name when renamed
		2. map to good entity

		
entity-multiple entrances:
	mobl model: 
		1. add sync+ lastsynced for every top level node
			.b mobl to flatten hirarchie only top one needs it(once, no rename)
	mobl_view:
		1. the normal view should be for free
		2. sync view needs tabs for every type
			a. map the screen to control every topEntity(might differ for entities)
			b. make the screen with just a tabset	
	json:
		1. doesn't change anything
	generate-mobl-unsynced-functions:
		1. change that there is a list now so filter all top Entities by sync = true
			b. note that this is a bit incorrect within hierarchie, than it is impossible to make difference between classes in one functions
	generate-mobl-services:
		1. TopLevelSync: needs to point to a new mapper which can handle multiple types
		2. SyncDirty: 
			a. needs to deal with list instead of single element 
			b. sync=true doesn't work on combined classes. use version =! 0 instead to be save
		3. normal services: the get a list of json Objects as param
		generate-mobl-sync-functions:
			1. normalSync services now need to build json like dirty each toplevel entity needs to be in there
		generate-mobl-total-sync:
			1. let go of the tree structure not sure if this would do anything at all. just do all the entities
			2. need to set for all TopEntities Last Synced
		generate-mobl-clear-function
			1. there is a list of TopEntities instead of one, we make no difference for clearing any more just clear them all.
	mobl-mapper:
		1. most of the mappers stay the same since the information is correct in json
		2. need a new TopLevelMapper to fix the different TopLevels
		
	webdsl-generate-TopLevelSyncService
		1. instead of one it has a list of entity types containing the entities to send

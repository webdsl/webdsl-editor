  //   (openeditor)  Indicates an editor should be opened with the result.                            
  //   (persistent)  Indicates that the resulting file should be saved to disk.                       
  //   (realtime)    Indicates that the resulting editor should be updated in real-time               
  //                 as the source file is edited.
